# Set

## Story. Once again you find yourself on the internal network of the Windcorp Corporation. This tasted so good last time you were there, you came back for more. However, they managed to secure the Domain Controller this time, so you need to find another server and on your first scan discovered "Set". Set is used as a platform for developers and has had some problems in the recent past. They had to reset a lot of users and restore backups (maybe you were not the only hacker on their network?). So they decided to make sure all users used proper passwords and closed of some of the loose policies. Can you still find a way in? Are some user more privileged than others? Or some more sloppy? And maybe you need to think outside the box a little bit to circumvent their new security controlsâ€¦
